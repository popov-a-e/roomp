<h1>What is Roomp?</h1>

<p>Roomp was a startup operating in 2016-2018 in Russia. </p>
<p>It was a chain of hotels with its own booking system, 
integrated with Booking.com,Ostrovok and other OTAs. </p>
<p>It's long gone, but its code lives here</p>

<h2>What can I found here?</h2>

<p>The code is abandoned and not supported, and uses old versions of Vue.js and PHP. </p>
<p>But here you can find useful ideas and approaches, if you're developing a similar system. </p>
